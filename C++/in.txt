We let the vertices of a graph be the animals, and we draw an edge between two vertices if the animals they
represent cannot be in the same habitat because of their eating habits. A coloring of this graph gives an
assignment of habitats (the colors are the habitats).
22. We model the circuit board with a graph: The n vertices correspond to the n devices, with an edge between
each pair of devices connected by a wire. Then coloring the edges corresponds to coloring the wires, and the
given requirement about the colors of the wires is exactly the requirement for an edge coloring. Therefore the
number of colors needed for the wires is the edge chromatic number of the graph.
24. If there is a vertex with degree d, then there are d edges incident with a common vertex. Thus in any edge
coloring each of those edges must get a different color, so we need at least d colors.
26. This is really a problem about scheduling a round-robin tournament. Let the vertices of Kn be v1, v2, . . . , vn .
These are the players in the tournament. We join two vertices with an edge of color i if those two players
meet in round i of the tournament. First suppose that n is even. Place vn in the center of a circle, wit
